title: "WIP Historic Pop Data"
---

Things to do

decide which ages we want... do we need 0 to 104?
if needed then group Age 90+ in projected
bin ages
some ML to determine important variables (ages) perhaps random forest to auto select a subset of ages?

get annual demand data included

 Thoughts
 Visualise data
 Show the correlations with variables and with demand
 Is total enough or does male / female split work better

```{r librarys}

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# my package to make pop data
library(UKpopData)

```

```{r load historic data}
# historic_pop_raw <- 
#     read_xlsx("../inst/extdata/ukpopulationestimates18382020.xlsx", 
#               sheet = "Table 3",
#               skip = 4,
#               col_names = TRUE)
```


```{r load projected data}
# proj_pop_total_raw <- 
#     read_xlsx("../inst/extdata/nomis_2022_08_04_115225.xlsx", 
#               sheet = "Total",
#               skip = 6,
#               col_names = TRUE)
# 
# proj_pop_male_raw <- 
#     read_xlsx("../inst/extdata/nomis_2022_08_04_115225.xlsx", 
#               sheet = "Male",
#               skip = 6,
#               col_names = TRUE)
# 
# proj_pop_female_raw <- 
#     read_xlsx("../inst/extdata/nomis_2022_08_04_115225.xlsx",

```{r}

```


```{r}
# check assumptions about the data

# all years are present from start to end year (has_gaps from tsibble)
# no na data
